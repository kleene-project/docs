## Example

- A small image: ![a small image](/assets/images/kleene_logo_141.png)

- A small image that is a link. The extra newline here makes it not show inline:

  [![a small image](/assets/images/kleene_logo_141.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cole_Kleene)

- Make the image open in a new tab: [![an image](/assets/images/kleene_logo_141.png)](/assets/images/kleene_logo_141.png){: target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"}

- Set the size of an image: ![a pretty wide image](/assets/images/kleene-example-1280.png){:width="750px"}

- A big wide image: ![a pretty wide image](/assets/images/kleene-example-1280.png)

- The same as above but using HTML: <img src="/assets/images/kleene-example-1280.png" alt="a wide image using HTML"/>

## HTML and Markdown
