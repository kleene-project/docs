We deeply value documentation contributions from the Docker community. We'd like to make it as easy
as possible for you to work in this repository. The following sections guide you through the process of contributing to Docker documentation.

### Additional resources

We also provide:

- A section of useful components you can add to your documentation. For components and controls, we use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- Information on Docker's [tone and voice](style/voice-tone.md).
- A [writing checklist](checklist.md) to help you when you're contributing to Docker's documentation.
- A command-line tool called vale to check the style and [help you find errors in your writing](contribute-guide.md#test-the-docs-locally).
