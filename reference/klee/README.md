# About these files

The files in this directory are stub files which include the file
`/_includes/cli.md`, which parses YAML files generated from the
[Klee](https://github.com/kleene-project/klee) repository. The YAML files
are parsed into Markdown files used for Klee's reference command pages.

See the [Klee help page](https://github.com/kleene-project/klee/scripts) to learn
how to generate the Klee YAML-files.
