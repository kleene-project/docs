amd64: |
  AMD64 is AMD's 64-bit extension of Intel's x86 architecture, and is also
  referred to as x86_64 (or x86-64).
arm64: |
  ARM64 is the 64-bit extension of the ARM CPU architecture. arm64 architecture
  is used in Apple silicon machines.
base image: |
  A *base image* has no parent image. It is created using one of the `klee image create` subcommands.
build: |
  *build* is the process of building images using a [Dockerfile](#dockerfile)
  and a "context". The context is the set of files that is used when building the image.
build container: |
  The container created and used for the image building process. If the build succeeds, the build container is converted to an image.
container: |
  A container is a runtime instance (a [zfs](#zfs) clone) of an [image](#image), and consists of

  - A ZFS dataset
  - Configuration of the process-isolation environment ([jail](#jail))
  - Zero or more network connections and volume mounts.
Docker: The Docker project, which is a container platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, ship, and run applications.
Dockerfile: |
  A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands you would
  run manually in order to build an image. Kleened build images automatically
  by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.
identifier: |
    When manipulating objects you can (sometimes) refer to them by an *identifier*.
    An identifier is either

    - An initial segment of the objects ID that uniquely determines the object.
    - The name or [nametag](#nametag) of an object.
ident: See [identifier](#identifier)
image: |
  Images are the basis of [containers](#container). An image is root filesystem
  snapt and some execution parameters for the container runtime. An image
  does not have state and it never changes.
jail: |
    Jail is term used for FreeBSDs mechanism for kernel process isolation.
    A set of processes running in a jailed environment is called a jail.
    Kleene containers are based on jails, with some additional configuration.
    See the FreeBSD handbook and man-pages for further details.
Klee: The CLI client used to interact with the backend daemon Kleened.
Kleene: The project documented on this website.
Kleened: |
    The backend component in Kleene that takes care of building images,
    creating containers, networks, volumes etc.
nametag: |
    Naming scheme used for images, following the format `name:tag`, such as
    `nginx:latest` or `nginx:1.24.0`. If a nametag is supplied without the `tag`
    component, Kleened assumes it is equal to `latest`. E.g.,
    `klee image build -t FreeBSD .` is equivalent to `klee image build -t FreeBSD:latest .`
parent image: |
  An image's **parent image** is the image designated in the `FROM` directive
  in the image's Dockerfile. All subsequent commands are based on this parent
  image.
packet filter: |
    Packet filter is the firewall in FreeBSD that is used by Kleened for network
    configuration and connectivity. Consult the FreeBSD handbook and
    man-pages for more information.
pf: See [packet filter](#packet-filter)
tag: |
  A tag is a component in the [nametag](#nametag) naming scheme used for naming images.
volume: |
  A volume is a designated [zfs](#zfs) dataset mounted into zero or more containers
  using nullfs. Volumes are used to persist data, independent of the container's life cycle.
  Kleened therefore never automatically deletes volumes when you remove a container,
  nor will it "garbage collect" volumes that are no longer referenced by a container.
x86_64: |
  x86_64 (or x86-64) refers to a 64-bit instruction set invented by AMD as an
  extension of Intel's x86 architecture. AMD calls its x86_64 architecture,
  AMD64, and Intel calls its implementation, Intel 64.
zfs: |
    Is the filesystem that containers, images and volumes are based on.
    Especially `zfs clone` and `zfs snapshot` are frequently used when
    building images and creating containers.
