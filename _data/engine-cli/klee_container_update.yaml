command: klee container update
deprecated: false
examples: 'The following sections illustrate ways to use this command.


  ### <a name="cpu-shares"></a> Update a container''s cpu-shares (--cpu-shares)


  To limit a container''s cpu-shares to 512, first identify the container

  name or ID. You can use `docker ps` to find these values. You can also

  use the ID returned from the `docker run` command.  Then, do the following:


  ```console

  $ docker update --cpu-shares 512 abebf7571666

  ```


  ### <a name="memory"></a> Update a container with cpu-shares and memory (-m, --memory)


  To update multiple resource configurations for multiple containers:


  ```console

  $ docker update --cpu-shares 512 -m 300M abebf7571666 hopeful_morse

  ```


  ### <a name="kernel-memory"></a> Update a container''s kernel memory constraints
  (--kernel-memory)


  You can update a container''s kernel memory limit using the `--kernel-memory`

  option. On kernel version older than 4.6, this option can be updated on a

  running container only if the container was started with `--kernel-memory`.

  If the container was started *without* `--kernel-memory` you need to stop

  the container before updating kernel memory.


  > **Note**

  >

  > The `--kernel-memory` option has been deprecated since Docker 20.10.


  For example, if you started a container with this command:


  ```console

  $ docker run -dit --name test --kernel-memory 50M ubuntu bash

  ```


  You can update kernel memory while the container is running:


  ```console

  $ docker update --kernel-memory 80M test

  ```


  If you started a container *without* kernel memory initialized:


  ```console

  $ docker run -dit --name test2 --memory 300M ubuntu bash

  ```


  Update kernel memory of running container `test2` will fail. You need to stop

  the container before updating the `--kernel-memory` setting. The next time you

  start it, the container uses the new value.


  Kernel version newer than (include) 4.6 does not have this limitation, you

  can use `--kernel-memory` the same way as other options.


  ### <a name="restart"></a> Update a container''s restart policy (--restart)


  You can change a container''s restart policy on a running container. The new

  restart policy takes effect instantly after you run `docker update` on a

  container.


  To update restart policy for one or more containers:


  ```console

  $ docker update --restart=on-failure:3 abebf7571666 hopeful_morse

  ```


  Note that if the container is started with "--rm" flag, you cannot update the restart

  policy for it. The `AutoRemove` and `RestartPolicy` are mutually exclusive for the

  container.'

long: 'The `docker update` command dynamically updates container configuration.

  You can use this command to prevent containers from consuming too many

  resources from their Docker host.  With a single command, you can place

  limits on a single container or on many. To specify more than one container,

  provide space-separated list of container names or IDs.


  With the exception of the `--kernel-memory` option, you can specify these

  options on a running or a stopped container. On kernel version older than

  4.6, you can only update `--kernel-memory` on a stopped container or on

  a running container with kernel memory initialized.


  > **Warning**

  >

  > The `docker update` and `docker container update` commands are not supported

  > for Windows containers.
